# Supermarket-sales-analysis-SQL

A complete SQL project that explores supermarket transactional data to uncover sales, customer, product, and operational insights.

---

##  Objective
- Query supermarket sales data using SQL  
- Answer key business questions on revenue, profit, customer segments, and product lines  
- Provide actionable recommendations based on data‚Äëdriven insights  

---

##  Project Description
The dataset captures **invoice‚Äëlevel** transactions from multiple branches, including fields such as customer type, gender, product line, payment method, quantity, sales, profit, and ratings.  
We create a relational table, run analytical SQL queries, summarize findings, and suggest strategies to boost performance.
